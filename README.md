# Isolation-Support for Low-Cost SoC-FPGAs
This repo contains a component called _Protection Unit_ able to filter AXI transactions using a configurable policy based on AXI IDs and address ranges.

In addition, a component to manipulate the IDs of AXI transactions, and another one to convert AXI-lite to full AXI transactions with a given ID can be found. They are used to define/overwrite ID domains which policies are based on. 

## Deployment Guide
The project was created in Vivado 2020.2 and should be reopened with it.

1. Clone the repository
2. Load the git submodules (`git submodule update --init`)
3. Add the repository's directory to your IP catalog in Vivado
4. Add these include search paths
   - _<repo_root>_/ProtectionUnit_0.1/lib/common_cells/include
   - _<repo_root>_/ProtectionUnit_0.1/lib/common_cells/
   - _<repo_root>_/ProtectionUnit_0.1/lib/axi/include
   - _<repo_root>_/ProtectionUnit_0.1/lib/axi
   - _<repo_root>_/ProtectionUnit_0.1/hdl
5. Instantiate the component in a block design
6. Configure the component in the block design using its GUI

## Configuration Register Layout
The configuration register contains a control and a status register (not implemented yet) as well as the registers to configure the policy.
Each register is 32-bit wide and can be accessed through a separate AXI-Lite interface.

### Control register
The control register has currently no function implemented. 

Address **0x00**

### Status register
The status register has currently no function implemented. 

Address **0x04**

### Policy Registers
Through policy registers it can be configured which domains may read/write which memory areas.

Within each policy register two bits corresponds to a memory region. 
One bits indicates read permission the other write permission.
If a read or write bit is set the domain of teh policy register has read or write access to the corresponding memory region.

Bits of unused domains and memory regions are always forced 0 by hardware.

Address **0x40 + 0x04 * domain_index** - There is a policy register for each domain
